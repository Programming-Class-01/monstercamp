        What does a creature look like?

enum elementTypes {
    earth,
    water,
    air
        wind
    energy
        fire
        plasma
        electric
    spirit?,
}

enum skills {
    this will be skill names
}

age = datetime (displayed as yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601))

enum Species {
    turtleduck,
    snakebird,
}

genetics = {
    elementType,
    species,
}

creature = {
    species: string, 
    name: string, 
    uuid: string, 
    elementType: {earth: 0.25, air: 0.25, water: 0.25, energy: 0.25}, 
    growthTier: derived from age, 
    skills:{skills enum}
}

Removed: 
    elementValues: Record<elements, number>
    type: elements
    skills: string
    happiness: number

Goals:
    Sequence of systems and interactions
    creature communication
    time matches real world, but not punished for not playing.
    Moral game for the masses (lolnope)
    Wonder trade breeding rejects (especially the bad ones)
